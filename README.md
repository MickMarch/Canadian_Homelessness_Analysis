# Weather Impact on Crime Rates
An analysis of Crime Rates in the Greater Toronto Area with regard to the impact weather has on crime rates.

## Project Overview
Can weather be used to predict crime rates? Are changing weather patterns affecting crime rates?  
 
Weather plays a role in our daily lives, it shapes our choices and behaviors affecting when, where and how we choose to carry out our daily activities. Studies into the impact of weather on crime have been going on for decades but what about here and now? Forbes recently published an article “A Different Heatwave Warning: Online Hate—Like Violent Crime—Soars With High Temperatures”.   
We are taking a look at Toronto Crime rates from 2015 to 2018 to see if changes in weather have affected crime rates.

Outcome:  Can we predict higher precedence of crime based on weather forecasts?  Can Police Services use weather to predict higher staffing levels, increased surveillance in high crime areas based on the weather forecast?  If our climate is experiencing changes will these changes affect the long term police services needs and budget?

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze data to answer the following question:<br>
***Can changes in weather affect crime rates?***
